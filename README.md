# Allie (2017)
This is a bot that I made for the
[AI competition](http://competitions.gathering.org/competitions/creative/kunstlig-intelligens) at
[The Gathering 2017](https://www.gathering.org/tg17/).

I [placed 5th](https://files.scene.org/view/parties/2017/thegathering17/results.txt) out of 15.

The code is messy, so don't use this as a reference for learning Rust or anything like that.

## How to compile
Just run `cargo build --release`, tested on rustc 1.16.0 (stable) and
1.18.0-nightly (c58c928e6 2017-04-11).
